      <h2>Thanks for checking out my Website.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am an IT professional with special passion for cyber security and programming. My goal is to implement secure concepts in designing the most robust
        and secure websites and applications. My love for information technology dates back to my high school years when computers started emerging in Africa. These little
        machines
        fascinated me so much that I grew a keen interest in knowing more about them. And that curiousity is what drives me.</p>

        <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
        <p>I have hands-on web development experience in building, designing, and maintaining websites and web applications. Experience with Modern JavaScript frontend frameworks
          including React.js, Vue.js, and Angular.js in addition to the basic core understanding of CSS, HTML, Javascript, and JQuery, with a clear understanding of the React Lifecycle.</p>

        <h3>Software Development</h3>
        <p>I have in-dept knowledge of various programming languages including Python, C++ and C#. I have knowledge of Bash and Shell scripting as well.
          Experience with implementation of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) model to design, code, test and deploy applications based on technical
          specifications using industry best practices and standard toolsets.</p>

        <h3>Application Security</h3>
        <p>Ensuring information security is one of my paramount gaols. With the increase use of the internet today, vulnerabilities to cyber attacks continue to
          increase. I strive to avert this by integrating secure concepts and best practices into the applications I build. For instance, implementing
          input validation techniques in my code go a long way to prevent attacks such as Cross Site Scripting and SQL injections. </p>

            <p>
              The art and science of photography has always been interesting to me. Capturing those beautiful images and memories are always refreshing and entertaining.
              I specifically enjoy macro, portrait and landscape photography.

          </td>
          <td class="right-col">
            <p>
              If you think traditional video games are fun, try it in VR and you will never look back. The level of immersion is mindblowing. And what's
              even more rewarding than gaming is working out in VR. You should try it!

          <td class="right-col">
            <p>
              I am the reason <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> said "once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward,
              for there you have been, and there you will always long to return". I am so obsessed with flying and being in the cockpit of a Boeing 747 or an Airbus A380
              is definitely on my bucket list. So during my leaisure times, I try to live this dream in a virtual environment on Microsoft FS 2020, and doing it in VR
              is as closest to the real thing as one can get. I can virtualy fly between any two airports around the world in real time.
